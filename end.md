# Reflection on the project

## What went well?
Ultimately, the project turned out well. We worked together nicely and proved to make a good team. Setting meeting times was fairly easy; we were always eager to share what we had completed with the other discuss the best way to move forward with the project. 

This constant communication proved to be exceptionally beneficial to the both of us and to the project as a whole. We did a very good job of being in contact and even when we were not actively meeting, we would send messages either via slack or some other platform to let the other know what we had been doing. This kept us up to date and ensured a lack of miscommunications and problems with the control flow or how the project was to work in general. 

We were able to split the task evenly and make equal contribution to push the project into completion (though more updates should be made before May 12th)

## What can be improved?
We didn't managed to contribute too much during the first half of time after we started our project, partly due to lack of time-management skills and too much burden from other classes.
One significant lesson learned is that, the best way of making progress is to start writing something, even though nothing is certain, but simply just create some files with names that make sense would help boost the eagerness to make contribution.
