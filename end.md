# Reflection on the project

## What went well?
Ultimately, the project turned out well. We worked together nicely and proved to make a good team. Setting meeting times was fairly easy; we were always eager to share what we had completed with the other discuss the best way to move forward with the project. 

This constant communication proved to be exceptionally beneficial to the both of us and to the project as a whole. We did a very good job of being in contact and even when we were not actively meeting, we would send messages either via slack or some other platform to let the other know what we had been doing. This kept us up to date and ensured a lack of miscommunications and problems with the control flow or how the project was to work in general.
