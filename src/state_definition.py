#Here is where you can define all of your states in a clever way to make your code more readable.
#Think of all the states your robot could be in if thrown randomly into a world.
#Currently the code is set up for a variable name being equal to an integer like:

#FOLLOWING = 1

#for each of your states.

# following left wall
LEFT = 1
# following right wall
RIGHT = 2
# turning
TURN = 3
# following state
WANDER = 4
